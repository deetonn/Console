When process starts, begin inner node.exe with a custom
script that starts a server on localhost. All endpoints
take a key, that only the current instance knows.

The main process communicates with node via a shared file
under the data directory (under roaming). This file is just a list of all requests made. This only serves as
a way to execute commands by clicking links on the TUI.
