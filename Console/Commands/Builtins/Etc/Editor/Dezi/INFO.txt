From the time of using this code (29/08/2023), there is no license present
within the repository.

It's a cool project, after trying it out it's really nice to use.

TODO: This project is unfinished, meaning there is work to do.
  1. When trying to go deeper into the file, the file contents do not
     update, and you end up with an exception. We need to update the
     ui contents with the next line of the file, and not adjust
     cursor position if we are at the bottom of the contents.
  2. The popup Ui elements are janky, it's expected with an unfinished
     project but I will work to sort these.
