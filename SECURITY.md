## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there is a vulnerability (at any level) discovered, please report it to a contributer. Visit their github page and e-mail them privately so the issue can be fixed in private, without bad-actors getting involved. 
If the issue is not a serious vulnerability, just create an issue so that people can get to work on it. If you want to fix the issue yourself, go for it.
